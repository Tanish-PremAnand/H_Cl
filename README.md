# H_Cl
Hand Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning and OpenCV
*	Designed and developed OpenCV and Deep Learning based Human Machine Interface using MNIST sign language database.
*	Gesture capture and image pre-processing using OpenCV and PIL.
*	Trained CNN model with 2 hidden layers and ReLU activation to achieve test accuracy of 95% with 25 different classes.
*	CNN model using Batch Normalization and Early Stopping to optimize fitting and faster convergence. Hyper-parameter tuning using Grid Search and Manual Search.
